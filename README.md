I like to play around with modding and am currently modding a game called [Himeko Sutori](https://store.steampowered.com/app/669500/Himeko_Sutori/). The main repositories here are:
* [HS Mod Loader](https://github.com/solimodsthings/hs-mod-loader)
* [HS Mod Publishing Tool](https://github.com/solimodsthings/hs-mod-loader)

I also maintain the following mods:
